# EPROM Emulator NG II

Based on the project by Kris Sekula:

I developed a version where the TTL logic was replaced by a CPLD. This made the circuit much smaller. 

Instead of the Arduino Nano I directly integrated an ATMega32u4. This is flashed with the bootloader of the Arduino Micro (Using a simple ISP programmer). After that, the firmware can be flashed via USB at any time using the Arduino IDE.

For the CPLD part a JTAG programmer is needed at the moment. A simple open source JTAG tool based on the FTDI FT2232H is sufficient. With the help of [OpenOCD](http://openocd.org/) the SVF file can be flashed. The Xilinx tools are not needed for this.

To go with it, I designed a case that can be made on a 3D printer. For this purpose, I have kept the housing as simple as possible.
